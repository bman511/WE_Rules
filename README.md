# Western Electric Rules
Western Electric rules are control rules designed to help managers understand and monitor the quality of a process.  These simple Python functions use the numpy and statistics libraries to determine if a list and a newly passed number violate any of the four WE rules.  I would like to add some interactive visualization and styling and update with some random data generation in order to provide a better look at how these rules come into play.  See the article on Wikipedia for more information.
